# MSFT - Bot Development

This repository contains a few examples of creating bots using the Microsoft Bot Services. The following are available:

### Implemented in C#
1. [QuickStart Example](/EchoBot/EchoBot/)
2. [Self Implemented Version](/SimpleBot/SimpleBot)

## To Get Started

Head over to the [Microsoft QuickStart Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) to pick you language and get all of the needed elements for developing your bot. For the emulator, I'd recommend the 3.5.36 stable release as I ran into issues with the current preview (at the time of writting this).
