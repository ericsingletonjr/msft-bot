# Simple Bot

This sample demonstrates a simple echo bot with state with ASP.Net Core 2. The bot will greet upon connecting and send an Adaptive.io Card and ask for an email.
Supply a SendGrid Api Key to your user secrets and you will be able to send a silly email to the given address.

This was build out of the Bot Framework v4 Scaffolding and adjusted as needed to learn more about the framework itself. Download the code and
run it locally using the Bot Framework Emulator to see it in action.
